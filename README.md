# Recruitment-Management-System
Project for CS 546 Web Programming at Stevens Institute of Technology. 
We did a lot of pair-programming to finish this project.

Step 1: `npm install` to install the neccessary modules 

Step 2: Seed the database
Run the following command: 
```
node tasks/seed.js
ctrl + c
```

The collections "users" and "jobDescription" would be populated by running the above command.

```
users: {
“_id”: Unique Id
"userType": "employer/applicant to differentiate",
"username": "username with constraints",
"email": "validated email",
"password": "password in *** (for UI) and in letters for mongoDB"
"firstName": "applicant's first name"
"lastName": "applicant's last name"
"phoneNumber": "applicant's phone number"
}
```

In this applicationDocuments collection, the filename cannot be hashed due to the library (archiver) we are using to download all the documents as a zip. Archiver uses the original file name. Also as discussed, please only upload .doc .docx. and .pdf files, there is no backend code that restricts the uploads of other file types. Uploading files of other extensions wouldn't break the code though!

```
applicantDocuemnts.files: {
"userId": "Applicant's Id"
"jobId": "Array of documents Ids"
applicationTime: "Time application was submitted"
"jobName": "Job Title"
"applicationStatus": "Status of Application"
"fullName": "Name of Applicant"
"docs": "Array of document ids"
"extraContent": "Extra Comments"
}
```

The collection "application" cannot be populated because it contains the fields, "userId" and "jobId" which are generated by MongoDB in the collections "users" and "jobDescription" respectively. 

The applicantDocument has two collections, "files"(applicantDocuments.files) and "chunks"(applicantDocuments.chunks) which is generated by gridFS which is a library in node.js. These collections are generated when a user uploads any documents.

Step 3: Run the web application
Run the following command: `npm start` OR `node app.js`

Step 4: Log in as an applicant and apply for a job
To login as an applicant:
```
username:    john123
password:    john@123
```

Step 5: Log in as a recruiter and either post a job or view applications
To login as a recruiter:
```
username:   mohit123
password:    mohit@123
```
